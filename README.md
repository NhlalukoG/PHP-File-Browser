This is a PHP Based file manager.

Reason I created this was to be able to freely browse my server's file system straight from my phone.

It makes use of PHP (Obviously) & a Qt (C++) binary file (misplaced the code, will update as soon as I find it).

It interacts with the bin file via shell exec.

Functionality
- Browse files
- Upload
- Delete
- View files (Text & Media files)
